# Course-Management-System

The project involved the creation of an RDBMS in Oracle PL/SQL Developer, aimed at optimizing the university course enrolment process. It was designed to streamline and enhance the course registration procedures.

The initial phase of the project focused on establishing a solid foundation by developing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and four Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) using Lucidchart. These visual tools were instrumental in defining entities, attributes, data types, and constraints, providing a clear roadmap for database development.

To maintain data accuracy and minimize redundancy, the project incorporated various data management techniques, including constraints, triggers, and sequences. These elements played a critical role in ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

A user role system was implemented to control data access, enhancing security and confidentiality. This feature ensured that users had appropriate privileges while safeguarding sensitive information.

Furthermore, the project introduced a graphical reporting system, utilizing views and report tables to generate five informative graphs. These graphs offered valuable insights into student grades, fees, professor popularity, and more, providing a holistic view of the enrolment process and academic performance.

In summary, the project successfully integrated database management and reporting, revolutionizing the university's course enrolment system for the better.
